## UX (User Experience)
<hr>

### Goal of the project
This project is intended to create an online presence for myself whilest introducing me as a software developer. It is also intended as an avenue to 
reach out to other webdevelopers for collaborations and at the same time to sell out my skills to recruiters for a software developer role. The updates seeks 
to incooporate more interactivity to the website.

### Value to the User

#### Typography
        
        Roboto is the main font used for the project. Anton was used for introducing the name of the developer in the first section
        as well as his title. the fall back font for the entire website was Sans Serif.
    



#### Imagery

    should revert the user to the home page.
2. Users should be able to use the form to contact the developer.
3. Users should be able to link up with the developer using the social media icons located in the footer.

### Anticipated future User Experience 
1. The user will be able to download a PDF copy of the developer's resume in further developments.
2. The user should be able to view the various projects the developer has undertaken in future developments.
3. the user should be able to access a blog on the developers experiences/perspective in future updates.

### Bugs
<hr>

#### Solved Bugs

1. <strong>Problem</strong>The footer was failing to stretch fully across the page in smaller screens.<br>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> Z-index property along side the right and left rule were used to solve the problem.


1. <strong>Problem</strong> Navigations menus in the header jammed up on mobile versions of the website <br>
    <strong>Soution:</strong> This was fixed with media queries and Javascript codes as well as bootstrap framework.

2. <strong>Problem:</strong> The introductory passage located by the profile image jammed up with the image on medium sized screen 
   and less. <br>
   <strong>Solution:</strong> The above described issue was solved by making the image container fluid.

3. <strong>Problem:</strong> the progress bar and lables in the skill section were not aligned.<br> 
    <strong>Solution:</strong> the progress bar and lables were brought to alignment by increasing the column of 
    the progress bars while decreasing the column of the the labels. the progress bars were then brought to 
    alignment using the CSS padding-top rule.

4. deploying google map api had difficulties in relation to key and billings, same was solved by providing credit card details on googles cloud website.

### Credits
<hr>

#### code
The code for the website were largely written by the developer (John Divine Anane) using the Bootstrap4 frame-work to a large extent.
Codes from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> were used to debug navigation bar unintended appearance. 

JavaScript codes were introduced from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> with the help of my mentor, Oluwafemi Omedale 
to solve mobile responsive navigation problems subsequentely resulting in the hamburger button seen on mobile view of the website. 

Dubuging of the image and text jam up of the first section of the website noticed in medium sized screen views as well as 
navigation bar menu issues in mobile devices was resolved with the help of Andrew Sokolic, a software developer.

Inspiration for the map functionality and making the contact form functional were derived from Mutt Rudge's lecture on the code institutes LMS.

#### Content

All content was written by the developer.

Inspiration for the ReadMe.md content was drawn from the Code institutes github page and literature from 
<a href="https://www.makeareadme.com/">link</a>.

#### media

All images were created by the developer.
